## Hello! I'm Rutvik, a freshman studying CS at UC Irvine.

**NOTE:** A lot of my code is stored in private repositories. Please reach out to me if you are interested in seeing them.

My first exposure to computer science, beyond programming alone, was the *Wait, but Why?"* article about the superintelligent AIs potentially arriving soonâ„¢. (Be sure to [read](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-1.html) it later!) While I wasn't completely sold, reading it sparked my interest in computer science.

Later on, I became interested in design thanks to my high school's web design class. Check out my design portfolio [here](https://bit.ly/GandhasriR-portfolio)! Now that I've gained some experience in designing things, I'm working on my actual development/implementation skills.

I'm also interested in linguistics, especially where it intersects with computer science. Although I have much to learn in both fields, I am particularly curious to learn more about how language influences thought, similarities between human languages and programming languages, and natural language processing. To that end, I am pursuing a minor in lingustics (for now.)
